Heyyy.!!
This is my first repository on github...
i will absolutely try to be consistent towards my learning & growth..

it is going to be my new chapter of learning..

# Basic Calculator in Python

## Description

This is a beginner-level calculator program written in Python.
It was created while learning Python fundamentals and Git/GitHub workflow.

The project focuses on understanding user input, conditional statements, and different types of operators.

---

## Features

The calculator supports the following operations:

### Arithmetic Operations

* Addition (`+`)
* Subtraction (`-`)
* Multiplication (`*`)
* Division (`/`)
* Floor Division (`//`)
* Modulus (`%`)

### Bitwise Operations (for learning purposes)

* Bitwise AND (`&`)
* Bitwise OR (`|`)
* Bitwise XOR (`^`)

---

## How It Works

* The user enters two integers
* The user selects an operator
* Based on the operator, the program performs the corresponding calculation and displays the result

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Git & GitHub

---

## Note

This project represents my starting point in programming and my commitment to learning consistently and improving step by step.

Future improvements may include:

* Using functions
* Better error handling
* Adding more features
